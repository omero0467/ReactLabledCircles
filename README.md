# Zoomable circles Data visualization

This project was an assignment I got from 
Samplead as an intern.
Each circle is meant to represent a group of job positions.
The visualization is meant to resemble a "slippy map" interaction (google maps, leaflet). In each level more child groups unfold...

The names for the groups are generated by chatGPT dynamically. Default to "Group Name" if the process wasnt complete.
